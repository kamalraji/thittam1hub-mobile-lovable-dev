## 1. Add Workspace Architecture Doc

Create a source-of-truth document that maps the spec to actual components and routes.

### 1.1. Workspace component map doc

- [x] Create `src/components/workspace/README.md` with:
  - [x] High-level overview of the workspace feature (purpose, key flows)
  - [x] List of all workspace components (desktop + mobile) with 1–2 line descriptions
  - [x] Section explaining how `WorkspaceService` routes map to `WorkspaceDashboard` and related components

### 1.2. Spec alignment & cross-links

- [x] In the new README, add a section **“Mapping to Event Community Workspace spec”**:
  - [x] Map provisioning & lifecycle requirements to backend services + `WorkspaceService`/`WorkspaceDashboard`
  - [x] Map team invitation & role management requirements to `TeamInvitation`, `TeamManagement`, `TeamRosterManagement`
  - [x] Map task creation and tracking requirements to task components (`TaskForm`, `TaskList`, `TaskKanbanBoard`, `TaskManagementInterface`, `TaskSummaryCards`)
  - [x] Map communication requirements to `WorkspaceCommunication` and `communication/*`
  - [x] Map analytics and reporting requirements to `WorkspaceAnalyticsDashboard`, `WorkspaceHealthMetrics`, `WorkspaceReportExport`
  - [x] Map template requirements to `WorkspaceTemplate*` components and `workspace-template` types
  - [x] Map mobile access requirements to all `Mobile*` workspace components

- [ ] Add a short link/note from `.kiro/specs/event-community-workspace/tasks.md` or `implementation-task.md` pointing to the new `src/components/workspace/README.md` as the frontend reference.

### 1.3. Architecture visualization

- [x] Add a Mermaid diagram in `src/components/workspace/README.md` that shows:
  - [x] `WorkspaceService` (service entry) → `WorkspaceServiceDashboard` → `WorkspaceListPage` → `WorkspaceDetailPage`
  - [x] How `WorkspaceDetailPage` plugs into `WorkspaceDashboard` and tabs (Tasks, Team, Communication, Analytics, Reports, Marketplace, Templates)
  - [x] Relationship between desktop `WorkspaceDashboard` and `MobileWorkspaceDashboard`

---

## 2. Enhance Workspace Roles UI

Clarify and improve how roles are surfaced and managed in the workspace UI.

### 2.1. Roles display in team views

- [ ] Review `TeamMemberRoster`, `TeamManagement`, and `TeamRosterManagement` to ensure:
  - [ ] Each member shows their workspace role(s) clearly (badge or tag)
  - [ ] Role labels align with backend roles / permissions model
  - [ ] Empty or unknown roles have safe fallbacks in the UI

### 2.2. Role editing flows

- [ ] In `TeamManagement` and/or related forms:
  - [ ] Provide a clear control (select / segmented control) for changing member roles
  - [ ] Show brief descriptions for each role so organizers understand permissions
  - [ ] Add optimistic updates and clear success/error toasts when roles change

### 2.3. Accessibility & responsive behavior

- [ ] Ensure role badges and controls are:
  - [ ] Keyboard accessible
  - [ ] Screen-reader friendly (ARIA labels, role descriptions)
  - [ ] Responsive and readable on mobile breakpoints

## 3. Add Collaboration Timeline

Add a timeline view that surfaces recent workspace activity (tasks, messages, team changes).

### 3.1. Timeline component

- [x] Design and create a new `WorkspaceCollaborationTimeline` component under `src/components/workspace/`:
  - [x] Visual timeline or activity feed layout using existing design system tokens
  - [x] Item types: task updates, new messages, invitations/role changes, template applications
  - [x] Support basic filtering (e.g., All / Tasks / Communication / Team)

### 3.2. Data wiring

- [x] Define a minimal frontend activity type (in a shared types file) and wire it into the component
- [x] Integrate with existing data sources or placeholders:
  - [x] For now, if backend endpoints are not ready, use mocked data behind a feature flag or clearly marked TODO
  - [x] Once backend API is available, replace mocks with real queries (e.g., via React Query + Supabase/REST)

### 3.3. Integration into workspace views

- [x] Embed `WorkspaceCollaborationTimeline` into appropriate pages:
  - [x] Overview tab of `WorkspaceDashboard`
  - [ ] Optionally as a sidebar/secondary panel in task and communication tabs

---

## 4. Integrate Workspace Templates into Event Creation

Wire workspace templates into the event creation and workspace provisioning flow (frontend side).

### 4.1. Template selection during event creation

- [ ] Identify the event creation form/page (or wizard) to extend
- [ ] Add a **“Workspace template”** step/section with:
  - [ ] A template selector powered by `WorkspaceTemplateLibrary`
  - [ ] Basic filters (e.g., event size, type, duration) if available in the template types
  - [ ] Preview panel using `WorkspaceTemplatePreview`

### 4.2. Passing template choice to workspace provisioning

- [ ] Ensure the selected template ID or config is:
  - [ ] Stored in local form state
  - [ ] Sent with the event creation request / workspace provision call on submit
  - [ ] Reflected in the UI confirmation for the organizer (e.g., “Workspace will be created using template X”)

### 4.3. Post-event feedback into templates

- [ ] After events complete, expose template feedback UI:
  - [ ] Use `WorkspaceTemplateRating` in a relevant post-event page or workspace summary
  - [ ] Clearly tie feedback to the template used for that workspace

---

## 5. Enhance Mobile Workspace Experience

Refine and polish the mobile workspace experience using existing `Mobile*` components.

### 5.1. Mobile navigation polish

- [ ] Review `MobileWorkspaceDashboard`, `MobileWorkspaceHeader`, and `MobileNavigation` for:
  - [ ] Clear navigation between Overview / Tasks / Team / Communication / Analytics
  - [ ] Easy workspace switching from mobile
  - [ ] Consistent use of design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

### 5.2. Mobile task & team flows

- [ ] In `MobileTaskManagement` and `MobileTaskSummary`:
  - [ ] Optimize list/board views for touch (tap targets, drag regions if applicable)
  - [ ] Ensure task creation/edit uses `TaskForm` patterns and validation

- [ ] In `MobileTeamOverview` and `MobileTeamManagement`:
  - [ ] Make invitation and role management flows straightforward on mobile
  - [ ] Add relevant toasts for success/error

### 5.3. Mobile communication & utilities

- [ ] In `MobileCommunication` and `MobileFeaturesPanel`:
  - [ ] Confirm message composition and channel switching behave well on small screens
  - [ ] Ensure optional utilities (photo, voice, location) are discoverable but not intrusive

## 6. Ongoing maintenance

Use this section to log ad-hoc improvements or bug fixes discovered while working on the above tasks.

- [ ] Document any new workspace-related components in `src/components/workspace/README.md`
- [ ] Keep `.kiro/specs/event-community-workspace/tasks.md` in sync with major frontend milestones
